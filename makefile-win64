# Make does not offer a recursive wildcard function, so here's one:
rwildcard=$(wildcard $1$2) $(foreach d,$(wildcard $1*),$(call rwildcard,$d/,$2))

# How to recursively find all files with the same name in a given folder
# ALL_INDEX_HTMLS := $(call rwildcard,foo/,index.html)

# How to recursively find all files that match a pattern
# ALL_HTMLS := $(call rwildcard,foo/,*.html)

SRC := $(call rwildcard,src/,*.hs)

.PHONY : all

all : $(SRC)
